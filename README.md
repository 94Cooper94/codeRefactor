# codeRefactor

## Deployed Site: https://94cooper94.github.io/codeRefactor/

Refactored an existing website that included some broken links, improper element taggings, and a few other aesthetic or performance based issues. In order to avoid becoming over-zealous about this project, I've elected to stop at simply altering the mistakes presented in the code and not altering the file structure-- some folks prefer scattered images-- I prefer organized and succinct folders. Nonetheless, the website is up to operational standards and runs well (for the most part)!

Below I've included a sample image of the >navbar< and an image of some of the page's >aside< content. Enjoy!
